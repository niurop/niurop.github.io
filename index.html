<h2>Hi, I am Marek, (learning to draw)</h2>
<p>I am best defined by my creativity and my ruthlessness in pursuing whatever I deem meaningful. I value the Real Freedom the most, but I also know that this kind of Freedom must be obtained throw hard work and self-sacrifice. My biggest interest is the World itself; I want to know everything about it. So I have deep love and appreciation for Physics, Philosophy, Mathematics, Linguistics, and much, much more. I adopted the kind of Stoic mode of Being but I am always Grateful. I strive for Truth, even when it is not comfortable kind. I love learning new things and I love passing my Knowledge on. As I already said, I am very creative but I also like to share, so feel free to browse through my work. I also love to talk and discuss everything, so don't be afraid to write to me ☺.</p>

<h2>My articles and My Thoughts,</h2>
<p>I think a lot, and I mean like A LOT. But I also like to share and discuss. So here are some of my thoughts in form of articles. Some are purely informative, some may be just fun, some are educational or exploratory and other may feel appalling for some (feel free to just skipping them). Those are just my thoughts, some of witch I write down only to sort them out for myself. I am always open for discussion, so feel free to message me (preferred way is by mail under each article).

<h2>My projects and ideas,</h2>
<p>Thinking is not the only thing I do. As a matter of fact, I am very practical and, although I like Beauty, the practicality takes priority. Most of my projects solve some particular problem I've encountered. But some are more visionary as is for example <em>FrameOS</em>. Everything here is free to use in any way accept things with [$] in their names (then refer to their description for details). You may suggest some new projects if You want something done, but I do not promise I will actually do them (only if they are interesting to me).</p>
