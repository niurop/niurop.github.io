<h1>Licenses.</h1>

<p>In my view, licenses and patents, as they are now, hinder and stall progress. <br />
Thus, I will only use licenses that promote sharing and progress. <br />
More on that at the end. <br />
I am using licenses reviewed by Open Source Initiative as they are provided by GitHub.  </p>

<h2>Licenses I use.</h2>

<ul>
<li>GNU General Public License v2..  </li>
<li>MI.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>My views on the topic.</h2>

<p>Ideas are fundamentally different from natural resources, thus should not be treated as ones.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Natural resources in contrast to ideas, are finite.  </li>
<li>Thinking of something does not prohibit others from thinking of the same thing.  </li>
<li>Taking something from someone is not equivalent to coping someones ideas. <br />
In prior the original owner loses something with no trivial way of getting it. <br />
but in later nothing is lost by the owner.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Even more importantly law should promote fairness and ensuing safety, not providing moneymaking facilities. <br />
It is obvious that patents and licenses don't follow those premises, especially the last one.  </p>
