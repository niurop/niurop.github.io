<title>My Philosophy (the essence)</title>
<h1>The basis for My Philosophy</h1>
<p>I only outline here the most essential parts of my philosophy, it is not in any way comprehensive. You will be able to read more in my articles or in my books (non exist yet).
Disclaimer thou, this is my Philosophy and You need not adhere to it. I write it so others can fathom to understand me and some may even find it enlightening.
But I do not advise to trust it as even I often question its validity.</p>
<h3>Order and Chaos</h3>
<p>As We are just humans, mere mortals or (as I've taken liking into) naked apes, it is already evident from Scientific experiments (mostly quantum mechanics), We do not see the World for what it really is. Even if our bodies feel and our eyes witness the Reality, We can only perceive the World in simplified often distorted way. Thus, the heavy usage of Symbols in our perception. The most basic and primal of which are <em>Order and Chaos, Jing and Jang ☯️, Masculine and Feminine, Black and White, Good and Evil</em>. They are so prevalent in Us that they are the basic duality through which We perceive the World. The Order is everything familiar, structured (where we see the structure), <em>safe</em>, but can also by brought to extreme as tyranny and dictatorship. The Chaos is the opposite, the unfamiliar, unstructured (seemingly), the unpredictable, but is also the potential. Both are neither <em>Bad</em> nor <em>Good</em> in themselves and neither can exist without the other as the World is comprised of both. As Order can emerge from Chaos, Chaos can emerge from Order.</p>
<h3>I pride myself a Scholar,<br>both a Physicist and a Philosopher</h3>
<p>For some this may be disturbing and quite peculiar as they are held to be the polar opposite. Where Physics concerns with the indisputable facts about the Real World and Philosophy deals with the untouchable, non-physical and abstract that can never be stated as indisputable facts. Even from this, One can see that they are but a complementary parts of the World and One cannot discriminate in pursuit of the Truth. In fact, I put forth that there are only two True Scientific Disciplines. Philosophy and Mathematics. Where Philosophy desperately tries to find the Order in the Chaos, the Mathematics begins with Order and pushes its limits taming the Chaos. The rest of the Disciplines can be constructed from them as is for example Physics. As it tries to explain the world first by observing the Chaos, then by logical and Philosophical deduction (often throw reduction) it extracts the Order and writes it using Mathematical language. From this description Physicists using the tools of Mathematics predicts what should happen stating the hypothesis to test if the asserted assumptions correctly describe the world and then experimentally validates them (most often falsifying the hypothesis). The process is then repeated indefinitely, giving us an Understanding of the World. In My view, the Physics has always been this way, and now we have only developed more sophisticated tools and techniques to ensure that our imperfect perception does not cloud the result. Thou I must say, that we still do not have absolute certainty in any of our findings as most of them are based on thoroughly tested but not proven assumptions and always have much uncertainty in them; not to mention quantum mechanics and that the 3σ-significance is just an arbitrary rule, as well as the fact that all the mathematical tools may be flawed as they are based on sensible but unprovable axioms. Thus, I conclude that proposing validity of Physics and denying the utility of Philosophy is ludicrous. Finally, I say that I pride myself a Scholar for seeking the Truth about the World, I am a Philosopher for seeking the Order and Knowledge in Chaos, I am a Mathematician for I combine axioms to tame the Chaos, I am a Physicist as I try to understand the World around, I am also a Linguist as I study Language and Communication (much of our Understanding begins with Language). In fact, I am doing my best to study everything the World of matter or otherwise has to offer, thus I am a Scholar.</p>
<h3>Meaning</h3>
<p>I was asked a question, ”would I prefer my Actions to be Meaningful or Meaningless”. How would You answer. It is not obvious at all, as both come with non-trivial consequences. By choosing the later, One chooses the ”easy” way, where nothing matters, everything is meaningless and pointless. For humans thou, it is also dreadful and hard to bear. But consequences are not so apparent for One walking this path. On the other hand, by choosing the former as I did (after much consideration, as my whole Being is at stakes), One must face the harsh Reality of the Being with its suffering and pleasures alike. Ones Actions are now so meaningful, that in some twisted way One must take Responsibility for Oneself, Ones surroundings and for the Actions of all the others.By doing so One invites the Chaos and embraces it. And it is not an easy feat. It can be outright deadly. But for Me, it is worth it, as it is the only way I see to at least scratch the Potential, as Potential is not found in Order, but in Chaos. And by voluntarily living with Chaos, One is constantly <em>Destroyed</em> and <em>Reborn</em> in an endless cycle. And each time it happens One comes a step closer to the full Potential and the whole True Being.
From experience (even thou I am on the <em>infant</em> difficulty), I can say that this path is not the broad, empty, newly build highway, but a constant straggle for balance on the thin line between Order and Chaos above bottomless pit. One must balance them quit softly as to much Chaos can give rise to Anarchy and to much Order can bread Ideology; both of which should be avoided.</p>
<h3>Stoicism</h3>
<p>As the Path of Meaning is so hard and brutal, I adapted the Mode similar to that of a Stoic. I assume there is some underling Logos (the Order of the World). It is the realistically unobtainable Perfect Order for which I strive. This gives my life the greater Meaning, allowing me to look past the present at the greater picture. Thus I need not to despair when things go astray or lose myself in the ecstasy when having great time (don't be confused, I still have fun. I would say that I am having more fun now then before). Moderation is the key, as they say.</p>
