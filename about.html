<h1>About.</h1>

<h3>Basic info:</h3>
<p>I am Marek Zielina, also known as Niurop.<br/>
I'm about 25, currently living and studying in Poland.</p>

<h3>Quick description:</h3>
<p>Despite being an introvert I acquired the so called people skills,which I will use to make my dreams a reality.<br/>
What drives me is simple, childish,unquenchable curiosity mixed with not fearing the unknown.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that I speak fluently in Polish and English, and I am not pure idealist, though I may often seam like one.</p>

<h3>Areas of my interest:</h3>
<p>My interests range from abstract subjects like philosophy or mathematics, through more practical ones like engineering, programming or biology, to sociology, linguistics, history and arts.<br/>
To put it simply, there are only few things that don't pick my interest.</p>

<h3>Few practical skills:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Talking to people.<br/>
I am not afraid of public speakings.</li>
<li>Programming.<br/>
I am more into theory of computation, so I know the math behind it, but I am quite proficient in C, C++, Js, Python and I know my way around Haskell, Lisp, C#, F# as well as many others.</li>
<li>Math.<br/>
I am making a degree in it.</li>
<li>Logic.<br/>
Probably the most overlooked skill one can have.</li>
<li>Learning.<br/>
The most useful skill and basic skill for any human.</li>
<li>Teaching.<br/>
One of the most wanted skill in combination with learning.</li>
<li>Hard work.<br/>
The only skill that will get you further than pure talent.</li>
</ul>

<h3>My ideals:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Correctness.</li>
<li>Simplicity.</li>
<li>Usefulness.</li>
<li>Progress.</li>
<li>Beauty.</li>
</ul>

<h3>My political and religious views:</h3>
<p>They should be of no concern here.<br/>
Although they are important, for functioning society, tolerance is as well.</p>
