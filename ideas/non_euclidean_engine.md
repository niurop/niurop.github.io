# Non-Euclidean physics engine

## Motivation.

Many non-euclidean spaces can be simulated in euclidean space but there always is a trade of.  
Even more problematic are spaces that can not be morphed into one without losing its properties.  
The best option would be a way of creating them as they are.  

As a bonus, I would like to add a way to make :
